## üîê Enable Google Authentication (Optional)

To enable the "Sign In" functionality, you need to set up Google OAuth:

### Step 1: Create Google OAuth Credentials

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable the "Google+ API" (or "Google Identity API")
4. Go to "Credentials" ‚Üí "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
5. Choose "Web application"
6. Add authorized redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
7. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret

### Step 2: Update Environment Variables

Replace the placeholder values in `.env.local`:

```env
# NextAuth.js
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here-change-this-in-production"

# Replace these with your real Google OAuth credentials
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-actual-google-client-id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-actual-google-client-secret"
```

### Step 3: Restart the Server

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```
